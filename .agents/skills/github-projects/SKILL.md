  Fully manage GitHub Projects (ProjectsV2) — the org/user planning boards at
  github.com/orgs/<org>/projects/<n> — through the gh CLI and GraphQL API. Use
  this whenever the task involves a GitHub project board, roadmap, sprint, or
  backlog: creating or editing a project, adding issues/PRs to a board, creating
  draft issues, setting or reading Status / Priority / Estimate / iteration
  fields, moving items between columns, building or reporting on a board, bulk
  triage, or setting up custom fields and views. Trigger on phrases like "add
  this issue to the project", "set the status to In Progress", "what's on the
  board", "create a sprint field", "move done items", "Projects v2", "GitHub
  project board", or any github.com/orgs/.../projects/... URL — even when the
  user just says "the project" or "the board" in a GitHub context. Also covers
  multi-agent coordination on a board: claiming items so you can tell which agent
  works which, keeping a local board snapshot to avoid hammering the API, and
  running an autonomous coordinator that spawns cheap worker agents to resolve
  items (open PRs, verify, auto-merge). Trigger on "coordinate the board", "have
  agents work the backlog", "who's working what", "resolve the ready items". Covers
  everything the Projects feature can do, end to end.

# GitHub Projects (ProjectsV2)

## Mental model

A project is `owner` (org or user login) + `number` (the integer in its URL).
It contains:
- **Fields** — columns. Built-in (Title, Status, Assignees, Labels, Milestone,
  Repository, Linked PRs) and custom (text, number, date, single-select, iteration).
- **Items** — rows. Each is a real **issue**, a real **PR**, or a **draft issue**.
- **Field values** — an item's value for a field (its Status, its Estimate…).

Everything is addressed by **opaque node IDs**. Setting one field value needs the
project ID + field ID + item ID together — and for single-select/iteration fields,
the option/iteration ID too. That ID-juggling is the whole difficulty; the bundled
scripts exist to erase it.

> **ProjectsV2 is GraphQL-only. There is no REST API.** The REST `/…/projects`
> endpoints are *classic* Projects (deprecated) and return 404/410 here. Use
> `gh project …` for common work and `gh api graphql` for the rest — never
> `gh api /orgs/.../projects`.

## Preflight (do this first)

The token must carry the **`project`** scope, or every command fails:
```bash
gh auth status      # confirm 'project' appears in the token scopes
gh auth refresh -s project   # add it if missing
```
A `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var overrides the keyring token — verify *its* scopes if
results surprise you. Private org projects also require the account to have access,
not just the scope (a 404 on a visible project usually means missing access).

## Reading through an ACP gateway (optional)

If the repository (or the environment) sets `ACP_GATEWAY_URL` — `lib.sh` also
reads it and `ACP_GATEWAY_TOKEN` from `<git-root>/.env.local` — every board
**read** goes through that gateway instead of your `gh` credentials:
`snapshot.sh`, `project-ids.sh` and `claims.sh` switch automatically, and no
`project` scope or GitHub App key is needed locally. Writes are unaffected:
the gateway is pull-only by design, so `add-item.sh`, `new-item.sh`,
`set-field.sh` and `claim.sh` keep using your own `gh` credentials.

With no gateway configured nothing changes — the scripts behave exactly as
documented everywhere else in this file.

**When a gateway read fails, read what it says.** Every refusal is JSON with a
stable `error` code, a `detail`, a `remedy` and the context needed to retry;
`lib.sh` prints all of it to stderr and exits `78`. Act on that text rather
than retrying or reaching for `ACP_ALLOW_NATIVE_GITHUB=1`:

| `error` | what it means |
|---|---|
| `OWNER_REQUIRED` / `PROJECT_REQUIRED` | the call named no board; the body lists the owners and boards the gateway can see |
| `PROJECT_NOT_ALLOWED` | the board is outside the gateway's `ACP_PROJECT_ALLOWLIST` — a deployment change, not a skill bug |
| `OWNER_NOT_INSTALLED` | the App is not installed on that account; the body carries the install URL |
| `PROJECTS_PERMISSION_MISSING` | the installation exists but holds no owner-level Projects permission |
| `APP_NOT_CONFIGURED` / `UPSTREAM_FAILURE` | gateway-side; check its `/internal/app-probe` |

With no board selected, the "no project selected" error also lists the owners
the gateway can read — or, when an owner is known, that owner's boards and
their numbers (`/internal/installations`, `/internal/projects?owner=`).

`tests/test_acp_context.sh` covers this path with a stubbed `curl`.

## Selecting the project (switch between boards)

Commands take `--owner <org-or-user> --project <number>`, but you can avoid repeating
them: pick an **active project** once and the scripts fall back to it.
```bash
scripts/project.sh use S2Forge 2     # set the active project (validated before saving)
scripts/project.sh current           # show it
scripts/project.sh list              # list the active owner's projects (★ = active)
scripts/project.sh list someorg      # list another owner's projects to switch to
scripts/project.sh use someorg 5     # switch boards
scripts/project.sh clear             # forget it
```
After `use`, the four scripts below run with **no** `--owner/--project`. Precedence:
an explicit flag **>** env `GH_PROJECT_OWNER`/`GH_PROJECT_NUMBER` (one-off override)
**>** the saved active project (`~/.config/github-projects/current`). The S2Forge org
board is `S2Forge` #2.

## The fast path: bundled scripts

Four scripts in `scripts/` handle the node-ID resolution that otherwise has to be
redone by hand every time. Prefer them over raw `item-edit`. They need `gh` + `jq`.
All accept `--owner/--project`, but fall back to the active project (above) when omitted.

**`new-item.sh`** — create an item and set its fields in **one command**. Pass `--repo`
to make a real issue (built-in fields auto-fill from it — the easy, recommended path);
omit it for a draft. See `references/conventions.md` for why real issues beat drafts.
```bash
scripts/new-item.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --repo S2Forge/generation \
  --title "SSRF guard on fetch-time URL allowlist" --label security \
  --set "Status=To triage" --set "Band=Wave 0" --set "Severity=High"
```

**`project-ids.sh <owner> <number>`** — the Rosetta stone. Resolves the project node
ID and every field's ID, data type, single-select options, and iterations in one
call (auto-detecting org vs user; `@me` works too). Run once, cache the JSON, reuse it.
```bash
scripts/project-ids.sh S2Forge 2
# → { projectId, title, fields:[{name,id,dataType,options,iterations}] }
```

**`set-field.sh`** — set item fields by **plain names**. Resolves the field ID and,
for single-select/iteration, the option/iteration ID; picks the right typed value
flag. Use repeatable `--set "Field=Value"` to set many fields in **one call** (it
resolves the project once) — prefer this in bulk loops. It prints a line per field
and exits non-zero if any field fails, so don't suppress its output.
```bash
scripts/set-field.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --item PVTI_xxx --field Status --value "In progress"
scripts/set-field.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --item PVTI_xxx --field "Target date" --value 2026-07-01
scripts/set-field.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --item PVTI_xxx --field Status --clear
# many fields at once:
scripts/set-field.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --item PVTI_xxx \
  --set "Status=In progress" --set "Effort=M" --set "Repos=generation"
```

**`add-item.sh`** — add an issue/PR by URL and print the new item ID, ready to pipe
into `set-field.sh` (idempotent — re-adding returns the same ID).
```bash
ITEM=$(scripts/add-item.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 \
         --url https://github.com/S2Forge/systems/issues/42)
scripts/set-field.sh --owner S2Forge --project 2 --item "$ITEM" --field Status --value Ready
```

## Common operations at a glance

| Goal | How |
|------|-----|
| List an owner's projects | `gh project list --owner <o>` |
| View a project / its fields | `gh project view <n> --owner <o> [--format json]` |
| Create / edit / close a project | `gh project create\|edit\|close <n> --owner <o> …` |
| List items (raise the limit!) | `gh project item-list <n> --owner <o> --limit 500 --format json` |
| Add an existing issue/PR | `scripts/add-item.sh …` (or `gh project item-add`) |
| Create a draft issue | `gh project item-create <n> --owner <o> --title "…"` |
| Set a field value | `scripts/set-field.sh …` |
| Read custom field values | CLI list (lowercased keys) or GraphQL `fieldValues` for node IDs — `references/graphql.md` |
| Create a field | `gh project field-create <n> --owner <o> --name … --data-type …` |
| Archive / delete an item | `gh project item-archive\|item-delete <n> --owner <o> --id PVTI_xxx` |
| Link project to a repo | `gh project link <n> --owner <o> --repo <repo>` |
| Convert draft → real issue | GraphQL `convertProjectV2DraftIssueItemToIssue` — see `references/graphql.md` |
| Claim an item for an agent | `scripts/claim.sh --item PVTI_xxx` (id = git branch/worktree; `--agent` to override) |
| See who's working what | `scripts/claims.sh` · hand off with `scripts/release.sh --item … --status …` |
| Look up an item id by name | `scripts/snapshot.sh id "W0.7"` (offline, from the local snapshot) |
| Refresh the local board model | `scripts/snapshot.sh` → `<git-root>/.board_snapshot.jsonl` (+ `.tsv` view) |
| Coordinator views (offline) | `scripts/coord.sh summary\|ready\|orphans\|stale\|mine\|prs\|done-open` |

## Traps that waste the most time

- **`item-list` defaults to 30 items** — pass `--limit` or you process a partial board.
- **`item-list --format json` keys custom fields by lowercased name** — `"Estimate"`
  → `.estimate`, `"Target date"` → `."target date"` (it does *not* omit them). Use the
  GraphQL `fieldValues` query only when you need node IDs or exact name mapping.
- **`field-list --format json` uses `type` (a typename), not `dataType`** — the
  GraphQL API and `project-ids.sh` use `dataType`. Don't cross the two in jq.
- **`updateProjectV2Field` replaces the whole option/iteration set** — omitting an
  existing option deletes it. Fetch current options first, pass them all back.
- **Single-select needs the option *ID*, not its label** — `set-field.sh` handles it.
- **Assignees/Labels/Milestone/Repository live on the issue, not the item** — set
  them with `gh issue edit`, not `item-edit`; they then appear as board columns.
- **Built-in workflows (auto-add, auto-archive, "closed → Done") aren't API-scriptable**
  — configure once in the UI or replicate with your own scheduled script/Action.
- **Reserved field names** — you can't create a custom field named `Repo`, `Repository`,
  `Status`, or any built-in (error: "Name cannot have a reserved value"). Use `Repos`,
  `Component`, etc.
- **Bulk loops run in *your* shell (often zsh), not bash** — in zsh, unquoted `$var`
  doesn't word-split (don't stash a command in a variable and call it), and `status` is
  a reserved read-only variable (don't use it as a loop var). These cause silent loader
  failures; see the bulk-load recipe and `references/gotchas.md` #14.

Full list with explanations: `references/gotchas.md`.

## Script index

Every script in `scripts/` — each has a usage header at the top of the file, accepts
`--owner/--project` (or falls back to the active project), and needs `gh` + `jq`.

**Items & fields**

| Script | Does |
|--------|------|
| `project-ids.sh` | Resolve a project's node IDs — project + every field/option/iteration (the "Rosetta stone") |
| `new-item.sh` | Create an item (real issue with `--repo`, else a draft) and set its fields in one call |
| `add-item.sh` | Add an existing issue/PR by URL; print the new project-item ID |
| `set-field.sh` | Set field value(s) by plain name (`--set "F=V"`, repeatable) or `--clear` |
| `project.sh` | Pick/switch the active project: `use` / `current` / `list` / `clear` |
| `lib.sh` | Shared helpers (sourced, not run directly): active-project resolution + free snapshot auto-align |

**Local board model**

| Script | Does |
|--------|------|
| `snapshot.sh` | Build/refresh the rich `.board_snapshot.jsonl` (+ `.tsv` view); `find` / `id` / `get` lookups |
| `coord.sh` | Offline views over the snapshot: `summary` `ready` `orphans` `stale` `mine` `prs` `done-open` |
| `repo-map.sh` | `generate` / `resolve` — turn a `Repos` hint into repo path + owner/name + crate |

**Multi-agent & autonomy**

| Script | Does |
|--------|------|
| `claim.sh` | Claim an item (Agent=branch + In progress) with pre-check + post-verify |
| `release.sh` | Release a claim (clear Agent), optionally move Status |
| `claims.sh` | Who's working what, grouped by agent (+ orphaned / stale-claim anomalies) |
| `spawn.sh` | Spawn a cheap headless `claude -p` worker for one ticket (`--role`, `--resume` for rework) |
| `coordinator.sh` | Autonomous loop: pick → claim → worktree → resolve → verify → PR → CI-gated auto-merge → blame/retry |
| `protect.sh` | Enable a required CI check on a repo branch (opt a repo into safe auto-merge) |

Worker role prompts live in `assets/roles/{resolver,verifier,triager}.md`.

## Files this skill creates

Caches/artifacts written at the fleet root — all safe to add to `.gitignore`:

- `.board_snapshot.jsonl` / `.board_snapshot.tsv` — the local board model (`snapshot.sh`)
- `.repo_map.tsv` — category/service → repo path · owner/name · crate (`repo-map.sh`)
- `.coord-log/<item-id>.log` — the coordinator's blame / attempt trail
- `~/.config/github-projects/current` — the active project (`project.sh`; machine-local, per-user)

## Binding a repository to its board

Drop `<git-root>/.agents/board.env` in a repo and every script in this skill
targets that board from anywhere inside it — no flags, no active-project state:

```bash
# .agents/board.env — committed; the gateway secret lives in .env.local
GH_PROJECT_OWNER=zachshallbetter
GH_PROJECT_NUMBER=37
GP_FIELD_STATUS=Lifecycle          # this board's workflow field
GP_STATUS_ACTIVE=In Progress       # ...and its state names
GP_STATUS_REVIEW=In Review
GP_FIELD_BAND=Phase
```

Only `GH_PROJECT_OWNER`, `GH_PROJECT_NUMBER` and `GP_*` keys are honoured, the
file is parsed rather than sourced (a repo file must not run code), and an
exported environment variable always wins over it.

## Using it on another board

Nothing is hardwired to a specific org or project. **Owner + project** are fully
parameterized — pass `--owner <org-or-user> --project <number>` to any command, or set a
default once with `project.sh use <owner> <number>`.

The **coordinator / claim layer** additionally assumes a field schema — an `Agent` field,
`Status` values `Ready` / `In progress` / `In review`, and the `Band` / `Repos` / `Gate`
customs. Those are **configurable via env vars** (defaults match the S2Forge board), so a
board with a different schema just exports the differences:
```bash
export GP_FIELD_AGENT=Owner   GP_FIELD_STATUS=Status   GP_FIELD_REPOS=Repos
export GP_STATUS_READY=Todo   GP_STATUS_ACTIVE="In Progress"   GP_STATUS_REVIEW="In review"
```
The full set with defaults is at the top of `scripts/lib.sh`. The low-level
project/item/field/snapshot scripts need no vocabulary — they already work on any board.
(The board it manages also needs an `Agent` text field for claiming; add one with
`gh project field-create <n> --owner <o> --name Agent --data-type TEXT`.)

## Where to go next

Stay in this file for the common 80%. Read a reference file when you need depth:

- **`references/conventions.md`** — how to create items so it's easy and the fields
  fill themselves: prefer real issues over drafts (auto-fill table), keep the field
  set minimal, single-selects for manual fields, body ≠ data. Also covers **multi-agent
  claiming** — how agents stamp the `Agent` field so you can tell who's working what,
  and why claiming is best-effort. Read this before designing a board or bulk-loading.
- **`references/coordinator.md`** — the full coordinator story: the local board model
  (`snapshot.sh` → `.board_snapshot.jsonl`) kept aligned for free, offline `coord.sh`
  views (ready/orphans/stale/prs/done-open), the repo map (`repo-map.sh`), PR
  verification, spawning cheap `claude -p` workers (`spawn.sh` + `assets/roles/`), and
  the autonomous `coordinator.sh` runner (claim → resolve → verify → PR → CI-gated
  auto-merge → blame/retry). Read this to drive the kanban or automate resolution.
- **`references/cli.md`** — every `gh project` subcommand, its flags, and JSON
  parsing patterns. Start here for routine board operations.
- **`references/graphql.md`** — the GraphQL queries/mutations for what the CLI can't
  do: reading custom field values, pagination, creating iteration fields, editing
  single-select options, converting drafts, views, bulk updates.
- **`references/recipes.md`** — copy-paste end-to-end workflows (triage an issue with
  a status, bulk-add by label, move a whole column, snapshot the board as a report,
  stand up a project with custom fields).
- **`references/gotchas.md`** — the complete failure-mode catalog. Read it when an
  error or empty result doesn't make sense.

When verifying a destructive change (delete, bulk move) on a **shared** org board,
prefer a reversible probe — create a draft, act on it, delete it — rather than
mutating real items, and clean up anything you create.
