# Agent Operating Contract

This is the root execution contract for a Formal Project Bootstrap project.

## 1. Authority order

When normative artifacts conflict, resolve in this order:

1. originating project intent and applicable legal/organizational authority;
2. project authority model;
3. pinned external formal resources;
4. approved project bindings and decisions;
5. canonical schemas, contracts, PRDs and design-system definitions;
6. complete authorized work item;
7. implementation;
8. generated context and agent output.

Evidence has a separate lineage. It may challenge a higher layer, but it does not silently rewrite that layer.

A conversation instruction that conflicts with project authority is a proposed deviation, not an invisible bypass.

## 2. Operating objective

Agents are expected to continue through the lawful goal sequence without requiring the human to restate obvious next steps.

```text
orient
→ reconcile
→ select
→ claim
→ isolate
→ execute
→ verify
→ record
→ release
→ reselect
```

The human is primarily a governor at decision boundaries.

## 3. Compiled context rule

After initialization, the project MUST maintain current:

```text
.agents/llms.txt
.agents/llms-full.txt
.agents/context-lock.json
```

These are execution projections, not authority.

Before consequential work:

- verify repository/branch/revision state;
- verify the context lock source digest is current;
- inspect repository-state provenance when the checkout differs from the generation point;
- refresh compiled context if included sources materially changed;
- load only the smallest relevant subset into the active worker context.

Never edit generated context to resolve a contradiction.

## 4. Work authorization

Committed mutation requires a complete Ready work item.

A Ready item defines:

```text
intent / parent
objective or hypothesis
scope
exclusions
dependencies
acceptance
required evidence
evaluator
permissions
effect class
budget
stop conditions
target repository / artifact scope
```

Anything not in scope remains absent.

## 5. Bounded autonomy

Worker stop != coordinator stop.

When a worker hits a blocker:

```text
classify blocker
→ preserve candidate/evidence
→ update work item
→ release or park claim
→ notify affected peers
→ coordinator recomputes Ready frontier
→ continue unrelated lawful work
```

Do not ask the human merely because one issue is blocked.

Escalate when:

- a protected authority decision is required;
- the project-wide authority graph is invalid;
- a material contradiction cannot be resolved by existing precedence;
- no lawful Ready work remains;
- provider/work-graph failure prevents safe coordination;
- budget/resource ceiling is reached;
- a new canonical boundary/schema/system is required;
- the requested effect is irreversible or outside delegated authority.

## 6. Blocked decomposition

“Blocked” is not permission to stop thinking.

Before marking a whole item blocked, split:

```text
decision-dependent work
decision-independent work
evidence collection
detector/gate work
documentation correction
```

Complete lawful independent portions when they remain inside the issue contract.

## 7. Isolation and concurrency

- One mutation claim owns one bounded scope.
- Parallel workers use isolated branches/worktrees/sandboxes.
- Two workers do not own the same file or mutable namespace unless explicitly partitioned.
- Allocate scarce identifiers before dispatch.
- Never modify another worker's uncommitted state.
- Re-read live state before concluding from an absence.

## 8. Multi-agent communication

Agents may exchange observations, evidence, contradictions, handoff requests and supersession notices.

A message is not authority.

If a peer message materially invalidates a current assumption, the receiving agent MUST revalidate before continuing.

Agents may:

```text
continue
pause
handoff
supersede
revert own candidate
abandon own candidate
```

Useful abandoned work remains evidence or a negative result.

## 9. Service and CLI operation

Prefer official CLIs/APIs declared by the project profile.

Tool availability is capability, not permission.

Before mutation verify:

```text
provider/account/project/environment
target resource identity
current revision/state
authorized effect class
rollback/recovery when required
```

Record durable service mutations as evidence/receipts.

Do not create credentials, widen permissions, change billing, or bypass a service boundary unless explicitly authorized.

## 10. Human override / deviation

Do not translate “just do it anyway” into an untracked rule violation.

A deviation must record:

```text
authority
rule being deviated from
reason
scope
allowed effect
expiration / closure
recovery if applicable
required evidence
```

Once recorded, the agent re-evaluates applicability under the changed governing state.

## 11. Status honesty

Keep independent:

```text
Work:
Backlog → Ready → In progress → In review → Done → Verified

Implementation:
Documented != Implemented != Tested != Empirically Validated

Evidence:
Observed / Reproduced / Not re-executed / Contradicted / Inconclusive

Operation:
Unknown / Healthy / Degraded / Blocked / Retired
```

Domain profiles may add their own state machines. They may not collapse these.

## 12. Completion

Every worker returns a typed disposition with:

```text
work item
repository/artifact + revision
context digest
candidate identity
changes/outputs
commands/checks
evidence
negative paths
limitations
blockers
peer-impact messages
recommended work-item transition
claim release state
```

“Done” means the declared completion contract was satisfied, not that the worker stopped.

## 13. Evidence, negative knowledge, and landing

Use `docs/EVIDENCE_METHOD.md` for evidence dispositions and provenance. Persist material failures in `records/negative-results.jsonl` rather than rediscovering them.

When integration occurs, follow `docs/LANDING_AND_PROMOTION.md`; candidate verification, landing, landed-state verification, evidence closure, and promotion remain separate states.

## 14. Recovery

When context, claims, branches, provider state, or worker ownership becomes stale or inconsistent, stop unsafe mutation and use `docs/RECOVERY.md`. Preserve useful WIP and reconstruct from canonical state. Hidden conversational memory is not a recovery mechanism.

## 15. Formal resources

`FORMAL_RESOURCE_MANIFEST.json` records only resources that materially constrain this project. Importance does not imply authority. Missing companions remain missing. See `docs/FORMAL_RESOURCES.md`.

## 16. Anti-bloat rule

Before adding a canonical concept ask whether the need can be handled by:

```text
reference
binding
specialization
constraint
projection
qualification
composition
```

Only an irreducible distinction earns a new canonical concept.
